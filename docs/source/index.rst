Welcome to ProxDeploy's documentation!
===================================

**ProxDeploy** is a SaaS (Software as a Service) product offered by **TensorBuilds**, a startup founded by Rohan Marar.  
We at TensorBuilds have our own Proxmox servers running 24/7, dedicated to managing CI/CD (Continuous intergration/continuous deployment) infrastructure and web hosting applications. 
We offer customers access to our server applications and our free guides, tutorials and documentations for getting started with fundamentals of Linux, Docker, hypervisors and virtualization, web hosting, networking, DevOps, and much more. 
This documentation is a record of all our free guides and tutorials, and instructions with step-by-step details on how to use our software applications.
